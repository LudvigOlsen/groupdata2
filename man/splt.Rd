\arguments{
\item{data}{\code{data.frame} or \code{vector}.
When a \emph{grouped} \code{data.frame}, the function is applied group-wise.}

\item{n}{\emph{Depends on \code{`method`}.}

Number of groups (default), group size, list of group sizes,
list of group starts, step size or prime number to start at. See \code{`method`}.

Passed as whole number(s) and/or percentage(s) (\code{0} < \code{n} < \code{1})
and/or character.

Method \code{"l_starts"} allows \code{'auto'}.}

\item{method}{\code{"greedy"}, \code{"n_dist"}, \code{"n_fill"}, \code{"n_last"},
\code{"n_rand"}, \code{"l_sizes"}, \code{"l_starts"}, \code{"staircase"}, or
\code{"primes"}.

\strong{Note}: examples are sizes of the generated groups
based on a vector with \code{57} elements.

\subsection{greedy}{Divides up the data greedily given a specified group size
\eqn{(e.g. 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 7)}.

\code{`n`} is group size}

\subsection{n_dist (default)}{Divides the data into a specified number of groups and
distributes excess data points across groups
\eqn{(e.g. 11, 11, 12, 11, 12)}.

\code{`n`} is number of groups}

\subsection{n_fill}{Divides the data into a specified number of groups and
fills up groups with excess data points from the beginning
\eqn{(e.g. 12, 12, 11, 11, 11)}.

\code{`n`} is number of groups}

\subsection{n_last}{Divides the data into a specified number of groups.
It finds the most equal group sizes possible,
using all data points. Only the last group is able to differ in size
\eqn{(e.g. 11, 11, 11, 11, 13)}.

\code{`n`} is number of groups}

\subsection{n_rand}{Divides the data into a specified number of groups.
Excess data points are placed randomly in groups (max. 1 per group)
\eqn{(e.g. 12, 11, 11, 11, 12)}.

\code{`n`} is number of groups}

\subsection{l_sizes}{Divides up the data by a \code{list} of group sizes.
Excess data points are placed in an extra group at the end.

\eqn{E.g. n = list(0.2, 0.3) outputs groups with sizes (11, 17, 29)}.

\code{`n`} is a \code{list} of group sizes}

\subsection{l_starts}{Starts new groups at specified values in the \code{`starts_col`} vector.

\code{n} is a \code{list} of starting positions.
Skip values by \code{c(value, skip_to_number)} where \code{skip_to_number} is the
nth appearance of the value in the vector after the previous group start.
The first data point is automatically a starting position.

\eqn{E.g. n = c(1, 3, 7, 25, 50) outputs groups with sizes (2, 4, 18, 25, 8)}.

To skip: \eqn{given vector c("a", "e", "o", "a", "e", "o"), n = list("a", "e", c("o", 2))
 outputs groups with sizes (1, 4, 1)}.}

If passing \eqn{n = 'auto'} the starting positions are automatically found
such that a group is started whenever a value differs from the previous value
(see \code{\link{find_starts}()}).
Note that all \code{NA}s are first replaced by a single unique value,
meaning that they will also cause group starts.
See \code{\link{differs_from_previous}()}
to set a threshold for what is considered "different".

\eqn{E.g. n = "auto" for c(10, 10, 7, 8, 8, 9) would start groups at
 the first 10, 7, 8 and 9, and give c(1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4).}

\subsection{staircase}{Uses step size to divide up the data.
Group size increases with 1 step for every group,
until there is no more data
\eqn{(e.g. 5, 10, 15, 20, 7)}.

\code{`n`} is step size}

\subsection{primes}{Uses prime numbers as group sizes.
Group size increases to the next prime number
until there is no more data.
\eqn{(e.g. 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 4)}.

\code{`n`} is the prime number to start at}}

\item{starts_col}{Name of column with values to match in method \code{"l_starts"}
when \code{`data`} is a \code{data.frame}. Pass \code{'index'} to use row names. (Character)}

\item{force_equal}{Create equal groups by discarding excess data points.
Implementation varies between methods. (Logical)}

\item{allow_zero}{Whether \code{`n`} can be passed as \code{0}.
Can be useful when programmatically finding \code{n}. (Logical)}

\item{descending}{Change the direction of the method. (Not fully implemented)
(Logical)}

\item{randomize}{Randomize the grouping factor. (Logical)}

\item{remove_missing_starts}{Recursively remove elements from the
list of starts that are not found.
For method \code{"l_starts"} only.
(Logical)}
}
\value{
\code{list} of the split \code{`data`}.

\strong{N.B.} If \code{`data`} is a \emph{grouped} \code{data.frame}, there's an outer list
for each group. The names are based on the group indices
(see \code{\link[dplyr:group_data]{dplyr::group_indices()}}).
}
\description{
\Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{lifecycle::badge("stable")}

Divides data into groups by a wide range of methods.
Splits data by these groups.

Wraps \code{\link[groupdata2:group]{group()}} with \code{\link[base:split]{split()}}.

# Attach packages
