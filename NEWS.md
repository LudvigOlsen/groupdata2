# groupdata2 1.5.0.9000

# groupdata2 1.5.0

* Breaking: Rewrites large parts of the numerical balancing engine used in `fold()` and `partition()`. This produces different groups in some cases. Outsources extreme pairing to `rearrr::pair_extremes()`. Now uses hierarchical shuffling (`rearrr::shuffle_hierarchy()`) in `partition()` and some cases of `fold()` (relevant when `extreme_pairing_levels` > 1).
If you need reproducibility, the last version prior to this breaking change can be installed with `devtools::install_github("ludvigolsen/groupdata2@v1.4.2")`.

* Imports `rearrr` for use in numerical balancing.

* Minor improvements to vignettes.

# groupdata2 1.4.2

* Improves documentation for core grouping functions.

# groupdata2 1.4.1

* Adds `summarize_group_cols()` for finding the number of groups per fold column along with statistics about the number of rows per group.

* Breaking: Fixes internal sorting of fold columns. This sometimes changes the order of fold columns, compared to the previous version.

* Adds `tidyr` as a required dependency. Previously, it was suggested.

# groupdata2 1.4.0

* Breaking: In `fold()`, the `k` argument can now be a multi-element vector with one `k` (number of folds) per fold column. This functionality required a minor rewrite, why you might see interchanged fold column names in comparison to the previous versions.

* Bug fix: In `fold()` and `partition()`, when specifying multiple `cat_col` columns *and* `num_col` in the same call, it would fail. This now works.

# groupdata2 1.3.0

* Breaking: The following functions now work with *grouped* `data.frames` (meaning that they are applied group-wise): `fold()`, `partition()`, `group()`, `group_factor()`, `splt()`, `balance()`, `upsample()`, `downsample()`, `differs_from_previous()`, and `find_missing_starts()`. A message is generated *once per session*, when the input is grouped, to help users understand why their code is breaking.

# groupdata2 1.2.1

* `checkmate` compatibility.

* Small speed up of `n_dist` grouping method.

# groupdata2 1.2.0

* Adds Zenodo DOI for easier citation.

* Adds `lifecycle` badges to function documentation.

* Adds argument `handle_na` to `differs_from_previous()` and `find_starts()`.

* Bug fix: In grouping functions with method `l_starts` and `n = "auto"`, `NA`s are now replaced by a unique value before finding group starts. E.g. `c(1,1,1,2,2,NA,NA,4,4)` yields 4 groups.

* More explicit: the `data` argument in `fold()` and `participant` takes a data frame, not a vector.

* Possibly breaking change: Adds `checkmate` input checks. Improves error messages but also restricts behavior.

* Adds `xpectr` as suggested package. Doubles number of unit tests.


# groupdata2 1.1.2

* Adds `all_groups_identical()` for testing if two grouping factors contain the same groups,
looking only at the group members, allowing for different group names / identifiers.

* Unit tests were made compatible with R versions lower than 3.6.

* Adds badges to README, including travis-ci status, AppVeyor status, 
Codecov, min. required R version, CRAN version and monthly CRAN downloads. Note: Zenodo badge will be added post release.


# groupdata2 1.1.1  

* Bug fix: `fold()` ungroups dataset before removing existing fold columns.  

* Unit tests are skipped on R versions lower than 3.6.  


# groupdata2 1.1.0  

* New main function: `balance()` used for up- and downsampling of data to balance sample size within categories and IDs. 
Thanks for the request from @jjesusfilho (#3).  

* New wrapper function: `upsample()` wraps `balance()` with `size="max"`.  

* New wrapper function: `downsample()` wraps `balance()` with `size="min"`.    

* Adds parameter `num_col` to `fold()` and `partition()` for balancing on a numeric column.  

* Adds parameter `id_aggregation_fn` to `fold()` and `partition()`. Used when balancing on both `id_col` and `num_col`.  

* Adds helper tool `differs_from_previous()`. Finds values in a vector that differs from the previous value by some threshold. Similar to `find_starts()`.

* Adds parameter `num_fold_cols` to `fold()`. Useful for creating multiple fold columns for repeated cross-validation.

* Adds parameter `unique_fold_cols_only` to `fold()`. Whether to only include unique fold columns or not.   

* Adds parameter `max_iters` to `fold()`. How many times to attempt creating unique fold columns. Note that it is possible to get fewer fold columns than specified in `num_fold_cols`.

* Adds parameter `parallel` to `fold()`. When creating multiple *unique* fold columns, we can run the column comparisons in parallel. Requires registered parallel backend.

* Adds parameter `handle_existing_fold_cols` to `fold()`. When calling `fold()` on a data frame that already contains columns with names starting with `".folds"`, we can either keep them and add more, or replace them.

* Fixed behavior in `fold()` when k is a percentage (between 0-1). It is now interpreted as the approximate size of each fold and used to calculate the number of folds. E.g. `k=0.2` will lead to 5 folds.  


# groupdata2 1.0.0

* New main function: `partition()` - used for creating balanced partitions by partition sizes.  

* New method category: `l_` methods - n is passed as a list.  

* New method: `l_sizes` - Uses list of group sizes to create grouping factor. Can be used for partitioning (e.g. `n = c(0.2, 0.3)` returns 3 groups with 0.2 (20\%), 0.3 (30\%) and the exceeding 0.5 (50\%) of the data points).  

* New method: `l_starts` - Uses list of start positions to create groups. Define which values from a vector to start a new group at. Skip to later appearances of a value. Use n = 'auto' to automatically find starts using `find_starts()`.  

* New helper tool: `find_starts()` - Finds start positions in a vector. I.e. values that differ from the previous value. Get the values or indices of the values. Output can be used as `n` in `l_starts` method.  

* New helper tool: `find_missing_starts()` - Returns the start positions that would be recursively removed when using the `l_starts` method with remove_missing_starts set to TRUE.

* Added argument `remove_missing_starts` to grouping functions. Recursively remove the starting positions not found with `l_starts` method.

* New method: `primes` - similar to `staircase` but with primes as steps (e.g. group sizes 2,3,5,7..).  

* New remainder tool: `%primes%` - similar to `%staircase%` but for the new primes method.

* Main functions and tools of this version is `group_factor()`, `group()`, `splt()`, `fold()`, and `%staircase%`.  


# groupdata2 0.0.0.9000

* Created package :)
