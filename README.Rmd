## Overview

R package for dividing data into groups.

* Create **balanced partitions** and cross-validation **folds**. 
* Perform time series **windowing** and general **grouping** and **splitting** of data. 
* **Balance** existing groups with **up- and downsampling**.
* Finds values, or indices of values, that **differ** from the previous value by some threshold(s).
* Check if two grouping factors have the same groups, **memberwise**.

```


## Functions

### group_factor()

Returns a factor with group numbers, e.g. `factor(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3))`.  

This can be used to subset, aggregate, group_by, etc.   

Create equally sized groups by setting `force_equal = TRUE`  

Randomize grouping factor by setting `randomize = TRUE`  

```{r}
# Create grouping factor
group_factor(
  data = df_small, 
  n = 5, 
  method = "n_dist"
)
```


### group()

Creates a grouping factor and adds it to the given data frame. The data frame is grouped by the grouping factor for easy use in `magrittr` (`%>%`) pipelines.  

```{r}
# Use group()
group(data = df_small, n = 5, method = 'n_dist') %>%
  kable()
```

```{r}
# Use group() in a pipeline 
# Get average age per group
df_small %>%
  group(n = 5, method = 'n_dist') %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(mean_age = mean(age)) %>%
  kable()
```

```{r}
# Using group() with 'l_starts' method
# Starts group at the first 'cat', 
# then skips to the second appearance of "pig" after "cat",
# then starts at the following "cat".
df_small %>%
  group(n = list("cat", c("pig", 2), "cat"),
        method = 'l_starts',
        starts_col = "species") %>%
  kable()

```


### splt()

Creates the specified groups with `group_factor()` and splits the given data by the grouping factor with `base::split`. Returns the splits in a list.  

```{r}
splt(data = df_small,
     n = 3,
     method = 'n_dist') %>%
  kable()
```


### partition()

Creates (optionally) balanced partitions (e.g. training/test sets). Balance partitions on categorical variable(s) and/or a numerical variable. Make sure that all datapoints sharing an ID is in the same partition.

```{r}
# First set seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Use partition() with categorical and numerical balancing,
# while ensuring all rows per ID are in the same partition
df_partitioned <- partition(
  data = df_medium, 
  p = 0.7,
  cat_col = 'diagnosis',
  num_col = "age",
  id_col = 'participant'
)

df_partitioned %>% 
  kable()
```


### fold()

Creates (optionally) balanced folds for use in cross-validation. Balance folds on categorical variable(s) and/or a numerical variable. Ensure that all datapoints sharing an ID is in the same fold. Create multiple unique fold columns at once, e.g. for repeated cross-validation.  

```{r}
# First set seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Use fold() with categorical and numerical balancing,
# while ensuring all rows per ID are in the same fold
df_folded <- fold(
  data = df_medium, 
  k = 3,
  cat_col = 'diagnosis',
  num_col = "age",
  id_col = 'participant'
)

# Show df_folded ordered by folds
df_folded %>% 
  arrange(.folds) %>%
  kable()
```

```{r}
# Show distribution of diagnoses and participants
df_folded %>% 
  group_by(.folds) %>% 
  count(diagnosis, participant) %>% 
  kable()
```

```{r}
# Show age representation in folds
# Notice that we would get a more even distribution if we had more data.
# As age is fixed per ID, we only have 3 ages per category to balance with.
df_folded %>% 
  group_by(.folds) %>% 
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age),
            sd_age = sd(age)) %>% 
  kable()

```

**Notice**, that the we now have the opportunity to include the *session* variable and/or use *participant* as a random effect in our model when doing cross-validation, as any participant will only appear in one fold.  

We also have a balance in the representation of each diagnosis, which could give us better, more consistent results.  

### balance()

Uses up- and/or downsampling to fix the group sizes to the min, max, mean, or median group size or to a specific number of rows.
Balancing can also happen on the ID level, e.g. to ensure the same number of IDs in each category.   
 

```{r}
# Lets first unbalance the dataset by removing some rows
df_b <- df_medium %>% 
  arrange(diagnosis) %>% 
  filter(!row_number() %in% c(5,7,8,13,14,16,17,18))

# Show distribution of diagnoses and participants
df_b %>% 
  count(diagnosis, participant) %>% 
  kable()
```

```{r}
# First set seed to ensure reproducibility
set.seed(1)

# Downsampling by diagnosis
balance(
  data = df_b, 
  size = "min", 
  cat_col = "diagnosis"
) %>% 
  count(diagnosis, participant) %>% 
  kable()
```

```{r}
# Downsampling the IDs
balance(
  data = df_b, 
  size = "min", 
  cat_col = "diagnosis", 
  id_col = "participant", 
  id_method = "n_ids"
) %>% 
  count(diagnosis, participant) %>% 
  kable()
  
```
 
## Grouping Methods
There are currently 9 methods available. They can be divided into 5 categories.  

*Examples of group sizes are based on a vector with 57 elements.*  

### Specify group size
##### Method: greedy
Divides up the data greedily given a specified group size.  

E.g. group sizes: 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 7   

### Specify number of groups
##### Method: n_dist (Default)
Divides the data into a specified number of groups and 
distributes excess data points across groups.  

E.g. group sizes: 11, 11, 12, 11, 12  

##### Method: n_fill
Divides the data into a specified number of groups and 
fills up groups with excess data points from the beginning.   

E.g. group sizes: 12, 12, 11, 11, 11  

##### Method: n_last
Divides the data into a specified number of groups. 
The algorithm finds the most equal group sizes possible, 
using all data points. Only the last group is able to differ in size.  

E.g. group sizes: 11, 11, 11, 11, 13  

##### Method: n_rand
Divides the data into a specified number of groups. 
Excess data points are placed randomly in groups (only 1 per group).  

E.g. group sizes: 12, 11, 11, 11, 12  

### Specify list
##### Method: l_sizes
Uses a list / vector of group sizes to divide up the data.  
Excess data points are placed in an extra group.  

E.g. `n = c(11, 11)` returns group sizes: 11, 11, 35  

##### Method: l_starts
Uses a list of starting positions to divide up the data.  
Starting positions are values in a vector (e.g. column in data frame). 
Skip to a specific nth appearance of a value by using `c(value, skip_to)`.  

E.g. `n = c(11, 15, 27, 43)` returns group sizes: 10, 4, 12, 16, 15  

Identical to `n = list(11, 15, c(27, 1), 43` where `1` specifies that we 
want the first appearance of 27 after the previous value 15.  

If passing `n = "auto"` starting positions are automatically found with `find_starts()`.  

### Specify step size
##### Method: staircase
Uses step_size to divide up the data. 
Group size increases with 1 step for every group, until there is no more data.  

E.g. group sizes: 5, 10, 15, 20, 7  

### Specify start at
##### Method: primes
Creates groups with sizes corresponding to prime numbers.  
Starts at `n` (prime number). Increases to the the next prime number until there is no more data.

E.g. group sizes: 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 4  

## Balancing ID Methods
There are currently 4 methods for balancing on ID level in `balance()`.

##### ID method: n_ids
Balances on ID level only. It makes sure there are the same number of IDs in each category. This might lead to a different number of rows between categories.

##### ID method: n_rows_c
Attempts to level the number of rows per category, while only removing/adding entire IDs. This is done with repetition and by iteratively picking the ID with the number of rows closest to the lacking/excessive number of rows in the category.  

##### ID method: distributed
Distributes the lacking/excess rows equally between the IDs. If the number to distribute can not be equally divided, some IDs will have 1 row more/less than the others.  

##### ID method: nested
Balances the IDs within their categories, meaning that all IDs in a category will have the same number of rows.
